    <h3 class="infobody">  <p>The invention that changed an entire era to build up information sharing is now a popular term ‘internet’. It has revolutionized communications, to the extent that it is now our preferred medium of everyday communication. Life has taken a major turnaround after the introduction of internet. People don’t need to travel long and hard to gain infrastructure since the technologies has brought them to the palm of our hands.People dont need to travel for other purposes except the travelling purpose itself.Today your heart belongs to smartphones in our hands and our soul belongs to the Internet.Every coin has two sides,since internet has been very important in our life .The most important thing is to know how to use it! While some people use these technologies to achieve success, some on the other hand seem to exploit the technologies for the sole purpose of entertainment and gave birth to so many problems such as addiction, hacking, cyber bullying, etc.The bad effects of Internet shouldnt overpower the good effects. The Internet is now no longer concerned with information exchange alone: it is a sophisticated multidisciplinary tool enabling individuals to create content, communicate with one another, and even escape reality.Virtuality has been our new world for us.Hanging out with friends, playing outdoor games ,chilling with nature these activities are in the verge of extinction now.</p>
        Me, as a student has felt the affect that internet has made in my life.
        <p> But before a student ,I am a normal human being who seeks entertainment for refreshment purposes, and i am guilty saying that my refreshment belongs to internet and i am addicted watching series !!!It sounds funny saying this as a tech student that llife would have been more real if there were no social medias.I have build up anxiety issues along with dissatisfaction in my life just because of social medias.But it doesnt mean that internet and technologies are not useful.They are useful till its not abuse.I compare social medias as drugs ,if done right it can create wonders to heal you,if not its like you are finished.</p>
        <p>As a student currently pursuing her bachelors on IT, the internet technologies have been an important asset to me. The vast knowledge that internet contains is a boon. Learning new things has always been my peek of interest, thus, the internet technologies have made it easier for me to gain knowledge whether it is related to my coursework or for my extra hobbies. Since we have been locked into our rooms because of the current state, the sources of entertainment has been very less. With the help of internet technologies I am able to pass my time  sometimes waste it too ,and gain knowledge at the same time while watching series and stuff. The social media platform provided by internet has helped me keep in touch with people I need. This is how it has been helping me in the present. Although it consists so many benefits, I sometimes find my self using these technologies more for entertainment  as I said before rather than studies and what I should be doing and wasting my time on it instead. So, internet technologies just actually what you have and its proper use totally depends on one that uses it.Can we imagine a world without internet? I guess our answers will be No.So,if we need something so badly then it becomes our responsibility to use it properly rather than wasting time on it or misusing it.Its our mind which plays games with us the more you dont wanna ruin your life ,the actions you take are probably opposite.I promise myself to watch one more episode but I end up watching the whole series.I may sound funny but its the harsh reality that Over use of Internet wont let us get up from our bed and work ..we have become lazy bones !!I think its time to Wake up.Isnt it?</p>
        <p>Overall, internet technologies have made a great impact on my life and I am pretty sure on the one who is reading this now as well. During this tough times, Internet has given birth to some of my bad habits too. As it can be said, internet is a very powerful entity, use it you grow or misuse it and cry the tears of sorrow! The proper use of Internet totally depends on the one that uses it. And in case of affecting my life, I am sure it has brought positive aspects to my life as well I am learning new things which i have never heard before, I am developing my skills and learning new things gives my brain more dopamine then wasting hours on the same platform where I can learn the world and create wonders.Its time for me you and the entire human kind to be more grateful towards what privileges we have rather than misusing it.So, lets start working on Internet for good purposes ,develop ours skills and grab all the intelligence to do better for us and everyone.</p>
